# Phil's Players

**[A hosted copy of the project is available here](http://philcluff.co.uk/players)**

A set of video players with simple GUIs for video engineers to use for testing.

I got bored of bad player demo websites which don't let me try my own media.

My intention is to slowly populate this page with players, using a simple, idiot resistant GUI.

## TODO

* Add more players
  * [SASH player](https://github.com/sfvideo/sash-player)
* Merge the two Brightcove Player pages, auto detect manifest type, or have a drop down
